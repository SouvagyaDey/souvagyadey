## Professional Summary

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with hands-on experience in **backend development using Python and Django**.  
My primary interests lie in building **scalable backend systems**, designing **clean RESTful APIs**, and working with **structured data and AI-assisted applications**.

I have a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**, backend architecture, and database design.  
I enjoy converting problem statements into maintainable systems and writing code that is readable, modular, and production-ready.

Currently, I am preparing for **software engineering roles** with a focus on **backend, data, and AI-driven systems**.
